                                    Kid Quarkstar and Happy Dog. Happy Dog later morphed into The Square and it was with them that he moved to Southern 
                                    California in 2000. In Los Angeles, to break even, he organized private guitar lessons for music enthusiasts. 
                                    The group Kara's Flowers was at that time in a period of change and Valentine helped them as a guitar teacher. 
                                    He was later enticed to be the band's lead guitarist. The Square went through a period of tension and turmoil and 
                                    Valentine left to join Kara's Flowers, which was soon after rebranded as Maroon 5.</p>

                                  <p class="text-white">Adam Levine grew up in Los Angeles; his father was the founder of a chain of boutique clothing stores, and his mother was an admissions counselor. 
                                    In his teens, as a student at the private Brentwood School, Levine and some of his classmates formed a band called Kara’s Flowers.
                                    A producer from Reprise Records overheard Kara’s Flowers performing at a house party and signed the ensemble. 
                                    In 1997, the year that Levine graduated from high school, he and his bandmates appeared on an episode of the popular TV series Beverly Hills 90210 and released an alternative-rock album, Fourth World. 
                                    The LP failed to sell, however, and the record label dropped the band, which then broke up. 
                                    Levine moved east to attend Five Towns College in Long Island, New York. While there he became familiar with rhythm-and-blues, soul, and hip-hop music—a new exposure that changed the way he thought about popular music. 
                                    Levine, inspired to try a fresh musical direction, returned (2000) to Los Angeles and reconvened the band. The group began playing in local clubs and soon signed with Octone Records. Renamed Maroon 5, the musicians in 2002 released an album, Songs About Jane, that showcased its new funky sound</p>

                                  <p class="text-white">Carmichael was born to a Jewish family in Boulder, Colorado, United States.
                                    His father, Bob Carmichael, is a photographer, who also takes pictures during Maroon 5's tours. 
                                    Jesse has a younger sister, Annie. 
                                    He first started playing the guitar in junior high, rather than the keyboards (for which he is known in the band Maroon 5). 
                                    Some time later, Carmichael, along with Adam Levine, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, started a band called Kara's Flowers and signed a recording contract with Reprise Records.</p>
